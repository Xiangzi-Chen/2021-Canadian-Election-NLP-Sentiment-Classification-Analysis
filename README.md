# 2021-Canadian-Election-NLP-Sentiment-Classification-Analysis
This project is adapted from the course project for MIE1624H at University of Toronto.

The purpose of this project is to compute the sentiment of text information - in our case, tweets posted recently on Canadian Elections - and answer the research question: “What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2021?” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insights into the Canadian Elections. For this project, we've pulled tweets regarding the Canadian elections from the announcement of the 2021 election to the day before the election for your analysis.
